Here's some of the things learned by Jason Goldberg running Fab.com I totally
agree with:

1. **Do one thing.**<br>
  Find one thing you can do really well and focus entirely on that one thing.
1. **Say no!**<br>
  Don’t do any thing else except for your one thing. Say no to meetings, ideas, proposal, b.s., outside of your core one thing.
1. **Service matters more than sales.**<br>
  Sales go up and down. Service lasts forever.
1. **Make mistakes.**<br>
  Take risks. Move fast. Learn faster.
1. **Celebrate your challenges.**<br>
  Force the team to focus on why you suck, even while you’re growing.
1. **Be transparent.**<br>
  The more people know, the better.
1. **Measure Everything.**
1. **Fill your gaps.**<br>
  Bring in new talent to spur further growth.
1. **Say please & thank you.**<br>
  People do things because they want to, not because they have to.
1. **Have fun.**<br>
  Life’s too short to do it any other way.
