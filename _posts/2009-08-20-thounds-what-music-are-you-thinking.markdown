Hey,<br/>
I'd like to suggest everyone a new amazing web project: [Thounds][thounds].

This web application let you record your own *sounds* and share them between your friends or *band members*.
Doing so new songs will come up mixing the *thoughts* of everyone on the Internet.

Now the project is still an alpha release, but it will be soon on line with the beta release, have fun!
